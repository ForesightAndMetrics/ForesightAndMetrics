- 👋 Hi, I’m Gideon Kruseman (@ForesightAndMetrics). I lead Work Package 3 in the Foresight and Metrics for the Transformation of Food Land and Water Systems Initiative in CGIAR see: [initiative proposal](https://www.cgiar.org/initiative/24-foresight-and-metrics-to-accelerate-inclusive-and-sustainable-agrifood-system-transformation/)
- 👀 I’m interested in the radical democratization of foresight analysis by ensuring FAIR foresight data and metrics and open source foresight tools
- 🌱 I’m currently setting up the WP3 team in the initiative 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cool foresight and metrics
